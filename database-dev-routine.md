A developer should run the following routine before starting work each day to ensure a productive day and avoid database-related issues:

    SELECT @@version to check the version of the database software and ensure it is up to date.
    SHOW DATABASES to check the list of databases and ensure the correct database is selected.
    SHOW TABLES to check the list of tables in the current database.
    CHECK TABLE tablename; to check the integrity of the table, it will check the table for any errors and also check the indexes.
    OPTIMIZE TABLE tablename; to optimize the table and improve its performance
    SHOW PROCESSLIST; to check the running queries and processes and ensure they are running efficiently.
    SHOW STATUS; to check the performance of the database, such as the number of slow queries, the number of connections, etc.
    
   It is important to note that the routine may vary depending on the specific workflow and the requirements of the project. Also, backup of the DB should be taken before starting work, this will help in case of any accidental data loss or table deletion.
