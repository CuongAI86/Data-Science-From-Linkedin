A developer should run the following routine before starting work each day to ensure a productive day and avoid git-related issues:

    git pull to retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them with their local copy.
    git status to check the current status of the local repository, including any changes made and which branch they are currently on.
    git branch to check the list of branches in the local repository and ensure they are on the correct branch for the work they plan to do.
    git log to review recent commits and ensure that their local repository is up to date with the remote repository.
    git stash to save any changes made locally but are not ready to be committed yet.

Note that, the commands order and usage may vary depending on the specific workflow and the requirements of the project.
